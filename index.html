I don't want to use the word genius, but I\'d be okay if you wanted to. What did I say to you about barging into my shuttle. Now you can luxuriate in a nice jail cell, but if your hand touches metal, I swear by my pretty floral bonnet: I will end you. Oh Spike, devour me!

That girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship. Sweetie, if he had a tussle with that Sasquatch, we\'d be in the dirt right now, scooping up the Captain\'s teeth. You can\'t spend the rest of your life waiting for Xander to wake up and smell the hottie. Either blow us all up or rub soup in our hair. It\'s a toss-up.
